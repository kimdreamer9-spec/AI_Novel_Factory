    "selected_hypothesis": "C (Psychology): The narrative's core formula is the creation of a 'Pressure Cooker of Injustice.' It dedicates the entire prologue to building maximum reader resentment against a perfectly hateable, incompetent villain, thereby creating an intense craving for the cathartic payoff when the protagonist inevitably gains power.",
    "analysis_content": {
        "description": "The prologue doesn't just introduce a conflict; it manufactures a potent emotional state in the reader: righteous fury. By showcasing an undeserving, lazy heir (Jo Hyun-joo) squandering wealth while a capable, hardworking protagonist (Nogi-seok) and his colleagues suffer, the story establishes an extreme imbalance. This injustice acts as a coiled spring. The reader's dopamine anticipation is tied directly to the promise that this spring will be released, and the protagonist will be the one to deliver the satisfying, systematic punishment. The commercial success hinges on how effectively this initial resentment is built and how satisfyingly it's resolved."

    "evidence_from_text": "\"미친X끼.\" (Immediate establishment of conflict). \"3개월 동안 밀린 월급부터 줘야 할 것 아니야!\" (Clear articulation of the injustice). \"적당히 삽겹살이나 사주고 끝내!\" (A line designed to maximize the villain's hateability). \"이런 놈이 아니라 내가 이 회사를 물려받았다면?\" (Explicitly states the core reader fantasy and the story's premise).",

    "actionable_insight": "The primary hook is not the power fantasy itself, but the intensity of the injustice that precedes it. To replicate this success, the initial villain must be crafted to be maximally incompetent, arrogant, and dismissive of the protagonist's (and by extension, the reader's) hard work and values."
