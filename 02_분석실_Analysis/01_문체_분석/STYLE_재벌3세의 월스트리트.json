    "selected_hypothesis": "C (Pacing & Psychology): The prologue employs 'Narrative Distillation.' It intentionally removes all descriptive filler to present the core fantasy (2023, Wall Street) in its most concentrated form. This acts as a high-speed 'dopamine contract' with the reader, promising immense scale and a relentlessly fast pace.",
    "analysis_content": {
        "description": "The extreme brevity of the prologue is a deliberate and highly effective commercial choice. By stating only the year and the ultimate global financial stage, 'Wall Street,' it bypasses traditional setup. This technique immediately satisfies the reader's desire for a grand-scale power fantasy. It creates an 'information vacuum' that generates immediate curiosity: Who is the protagonist, and what are they doing at the pinnacle of finance? This signals to the reader that the story will be dense with action and progression, respecting their time and desire for constant engagement."
    },
    "evidence_from_text": "\"2023년. 뉴욕 주, 월 스트리트(Wall Street)\" - The entire prologue is this single line. Its power is in what is omitted. The complete lack of character, action, or description forces the reader to focus solely on the high-concept premise, promising a story that gets straight to the point.",
    "rubric_match_score": 10,
    "actionable_insight": "Launch directly into the core premise or setting within the first 50 characters to establish scale and promise a fast-paced narrative, creating an immediate 'dopamine contract' with the reader."
