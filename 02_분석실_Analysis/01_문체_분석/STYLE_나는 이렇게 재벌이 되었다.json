    "selected_hypothesis": "C (Psychology): The narrative functions as an 'Injustice-Payoff Engine.' It meticulously builds a lifetime of profound failure and systemic injustice in the prologue, creating a massive emotional deficit that the subsequent regression narrative is designed to repay with interest, providing intense reader satisfaction.",
    "analysis_content": {
        "description": "The core strategy is not simply regression; it's the weaponization of reader sympathy. The prologue compresses an entire life of suffering—orphanhood, abuse, corporate betrayal (modeled on the historical IMF crisis), business failure, and a tragic death—into a single, powerful emotional charge. This creates an overwhelming sense of 'Lack.' The story's commercial appeal hinges on the promise of correcting these historical and personal injustices, turning the protagonist's future knowledge into a tool for ultimate validation and revenge against a life of futility.",

    "evidence_from_text": "'...살만하다 싶으면 고꾸라지는 이따위 삶에 신물이 났다.' (I'm sick and tired of this life where everything collapses just when it seems to be getting better.) - This line perfectly encapsulates the core injustice. '아들, 열심히 공부해서 돈 많이 버는 부자가 돼야 한다.' (Son, you must study hard and become a rich man.) - This establishes the simple, unfulfilled desire that will drive the protagonist's second life.",
    "rubric_match_score": 10,
    "actionable_insight": "Maximize the protagonist's initial suffering and sense of injustice. The more unfair the first life feels, the more satisfying and cathartic every victory in the second life will be for the reader. The prologue should serve as an emotional 'debt' that the rest of the story repays."
