    "selected_hypothesis": "C (Psychology): The narrative's primary dopamine loop is the 'Intellectual Power Fantasy.' It weaponizes future knowledge in the high-stakes, logic-driven arena of Wall Street, allowing readers to experience vicarious omniscience and control over a system that feels overwhelmingly complex in real life.",

        "description": "This novel thrives by transforming complex financial markets into a solvable puzzle for the protagonist. His charm isn't just wealth acquisition; it's the intellectual domination he exerts over established financial giants and his own powerful family. He doesn't just win; he demonstrates prophetic foresight, making powerful people look foolish. This satisfies the reader's desire to outsmart 'the system' and be recognized for superior intellect, a potent power fantasy in the modern age.",

    "evidence_from_text": "\"Coca-Cola is not just a drink, it's my declaration of independence.\" - This line, tied to the Chapter 4-7 titles, establishes the protagonist's clear goal and the symbolic nature of his first major move. It's not about money, but about breaking free from the villain's control. \"They see a child playing with stocks. I see the future they are blind to.\" - Defines the core conflict dynamic: the protagonist's hidden knowledge versus the establishment's arrogant ignorance.",

    "actionable_insight": "Ensure the protagonist's financial victories are consistently framed as intellectual triumphs over specific, arrogant antagonists (e.g., the family patriarch, a rival firm). The emotional payoff comes not from the money earned, but from the validation of the protagonist's 'impossible' knowledge and the humbling of his powerful doubters."
