    "selected_hypothesis": "C (Psychology): The narrative's core engine is the 'Injustice-Correction Loop.' It meticulously catalogues three layers of systemic failure (familial, corporate, societal) in the prologue, creating a powerful reader desire for cathartic revenge and reconstruction through regression.",
    "analysis_content": {
        "description": "The protagonist is not just an unfortunate man; he's a victim of systemic collapse at every stage of his life—a truck driver with no insurance, a greedy corporate chairman, and a negligent prime contractor. The story's appeal lies in the promise of using future knowledge not just for personal gain, but to dismantle and correct the specific, relatable injustices that destroyed him. His expertise in construction provides a tangible, grounded 'superpower' for this correction, promising satisfying, technical problem-solving alongside financial and personal revenge.",

    "evidence_from_text": "Final monologue: '...following my parents' words, I studied hard, but I didn't become a great person, nor did I earn a lot of money, and I couldn't even achieve what I thought was easiest: living happily with my family.' This quote perfectly summarizes the protagonist's multiple failures and sets the clear objectives for his second life.",

    "actionable_insight": "The protagonist's motivation must be tied to fixing past systemic failures, not just personal enrichment. Each major arc should correspond to correcting a specific tragedy outlined in the prologue (e.g., preventing the Daese collapse, ensuring safety standards in construction) to maximize reader catharsis."
