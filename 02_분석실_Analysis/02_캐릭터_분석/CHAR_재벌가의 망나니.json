    "selected_hypothesis": "C (Psychology): The narrative's core engine is 'Vicarious Catharsis through Justified Rage'. It establishes an intensely relatable workplace injustice scenario, making the protagonist a vessel for the reader's own frustrations, and promises a powerful, satisfying revenge.",
    "analysis_content": {
        "description": "The prologue masterfully constructs a high-pressure environment of extreme unfairness. The protagonist, Noh Gi-seok, is a competent and dedicated employee suffering under an incompetent, nepotistic boss. This setup is a direct injection of 'soda' (a Korean term for frustrating situations) that makes the reader crave the 'cider' (the satisfying resolution). The formula lies in making the villain so despicably hateable and the protagonist so righteously angry that the reader feels the injustice personally, ensuring they are hooked for the inevitable payback.",

    "evidence_from_text": "\"3개월 동안 밀린 월급부터 줘야 할 것 아니야!\" (Shouldn't you pay the overdue wages for the past 3 months first!) - This line immediately establishes the core injustice and the Protagonist's 'lack'. \"적당히 삽겹살이나 사주고 끝내! 알았어?\" (Just buy them some pork belly and be done with it! Got it?) - This quote cements the Villain's character as utterly despicable, maximizing reader outrage.",
    "rubric_match_score": 10,
    "actionable_insight": "To maximize initial engagement, create a villain who is not just evil, but personally and contemptuously dismissive of the protagonist's and their colleagues' hard work. This makes the conflict feel personal to the reader and generates a powerful craving for vicarious revenge."
