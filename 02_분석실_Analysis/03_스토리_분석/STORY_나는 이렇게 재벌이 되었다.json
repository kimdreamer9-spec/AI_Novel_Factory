    "selected_hypothesis": "C (Dopamine Trigger): The hook's power comes from a 'Maximum Resentment Engine'. The prologue meticulously constructs a life of relentless, unrewarded effort, creating an intense emotional debt with the reader. The promise of regression serves as the anticipated 'cider' to repay this debt, guaranteeing reader engagement.",
    "analysis_content": {
        "description": "The narrative's hook isn't simply a tragic event; it's the culmination of a lifetime of systemic and personal injustices. The protagonist is portrayed as the ultimate victim of circumstance despite his perfect adherence to the social contract of 'work hard and you will succeed.' The prologue layers multiple tragedies: the accidental death of his parents, abuse from his relatives, the betrayal by a company he dedicated 15 years to (modeled on the Daewoo collapse), and finally, a modern construction disaster he is unfairly blamed for. This creates a powerful 'injustice gap' that the reader desperately wants to see closed. The subsequent regression is not just a second chance; it's a cosmic rebalancing that the reader is emotionally invested in from the very first chapter.",

    "evidence_from_text": "\"무엇보다 살만하다 싶으면 고꾸라지는 이따위 삶에 신물이 났다.\" (More than anything, I was sick and tired of this damn life where I get knocked down every time I'm about to make it.) - This sentence is the thesis statement of the protagonist's resentment. \"부모님 말씀에 따라 공부는 열심히 했지만, 훌륭한 사람이 되지도 못했고, 돈도 많이 벌지 못했고, 가장 쉽다고 여겼던 가족끼리 오순도순 행복하게 사는 것조차 이루지 못했다.\" (I studied hard like my parents said, but I didn't become a great person, didn't earn much money, and couldn't even achieve the simplest thing: living happily with my family.) - This clearly defines the failures he will rectify, setting the goals for the entire story.",
    "rubric_match_score": 10,
    "actionable_insight": "Maximize the contrast between the protagonist's immense effort and his tragic results in the first episode. The greater the injustice felt by the reader, the stronger the hook and the more satisfying the eventual success will be. Make the failure feel systemic and undeserved, not a result of the protagonist's flaws."
