    "selected_hypothesis": "B (Unique Twist): The narrative hook is a 'Catastrophic Premise Shift'. It establishes a relatable 'get-rich-quick' fantasy only to violently pivot into a high-stakes survival/nation-building scenario, creating massive reader whiplash and engagement.",

        "description": "The first episode masterfully baits the reader with a common power fantasy: an ordinary but skilled professional (unemployed, from Silicon Valley) gets an unbelievably lucrative and powerful job through a lucky connection. The protagonist's motivation is purely financial, making his morally grey decision to work for a dictator highly relatable. This seemingly low-stakes 'office story' is a setup. The true 'Winning Formula', confirmed by the meta-data, is the impending violent incident (cabinet annihilation) that will destroy the existing power structure and force the unprepared protagonist into absolute authority. This bait-and-switch, a sudden genre shift from corporate fantasy to a political survival thriller, is the core engine of the hook.",

With room, board, and a car provided.)\" - This quote exemplifies the mundane, materialistic desire that baits the MC and reader. \"내일부터 출근하겠습니다. 일이야 차차 배우면 되겠죠. 하하. (I'll start tomorrow. I guess I'll learn the work as I go. Haha.)\" - This shows the MC's quick, almost naive acceptance, which builds a false sense of security right before the catastrophic event mentioned in the RAG.",
