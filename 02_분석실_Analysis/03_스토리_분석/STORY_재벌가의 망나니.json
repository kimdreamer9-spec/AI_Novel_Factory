    "selected_hypothesis": "C (Psychology): The winning formula is a high-speed 'Resentment Compression Engine'. It manufactures maximum reader frustration and provides an immediate, vicarious 'cider' release within a single prologue, perfectly priming the audience for the inevitable 'What If' regression hook.",

        "description": "The prologue's structure is a masterclass in commercial efficiency. It immediately establishes a universally relatable conflict: a competent, hard-working protagonist (Nogi-seok) suffering under an incompetent, selfish, nepotistic boss (Jo Hyun-joo). The narrative generates intense frustration through a simple, powerful symbol—the boss's new luxury car versus three months of unpaid employee salaries. The 'cider' payoff is delivered swiftly and physically when the protagonist confronts the boss, grabbing his collar and verbally eviscerating him. This acts as a proxy for the reader's own frustrations. The episode concludes with a clear, explicit hook—'What if I had inherited the company?'—which perfectly sets the stage for the regression/transmigration that the genre audience expects and desires.",

    "actionable_insight": "To create a powerful opening hook, compress the entire justification for the protagonist's second chance into the first episode. Present a clear injustice, allow the protagonist to confront it directly for an immediate 'cider' payoff, and end with an explicit 'what if' question that the rest of the story will answer."
